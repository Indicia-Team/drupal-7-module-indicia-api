# drupal-7-module-indicia_api

The Indicia API module was created to allow external applications to communicate with the web-site
that hosts the module and so indirectly with the warehouse. 


It replies with headers that enable cross-origin requests. The server hosting 
the module must respond to http OPTIONS, GET, PUT and POST to support all the 
available features.
