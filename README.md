# drupal-7-module-indicia_api

The Indicia API module was created to allow external applications to communicate with the web-site
that hosts the module and so indirectly with the warehouse. 

For more information, see the 
[Mobile Authentication Module documentation](http://indicia-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site-building/iform/modules/mobile-auth/intro.html).
